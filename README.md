What is Python? 
Executive Summary
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

## Evolution of Python.

 -Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in the late eighties at the ' National Research Institute       for Mathematics and Computer Science, at Netherlands.

 Python Editions 

  - Python 1.0
  - Python 2.0
  - Python 3.0

Advantages of  using Python

- Python has several features that make it well suited for data science

- Open source and community development 

- Developed under Open Source Intiative approved license making it free to use and      distribute even commercially

- Syntax used is simple to understand and code 

- Libraries designed for specific data science tasks 

- Combines well with majority of the cloud platform service providers

Integrated development enviroment (IDE)

- Software application consisiting of a cohesive unit of tools required for development

- Designed to simplify software development

- Utilities Provided by IDEs include tools for managing, compiling, deploying and debugging software

## Feature of IDE 

- IDE should centralize three key tools nthat form the crux of software development 

- Syntax and error highlighting 

-  Code completion 

- Version control

## Commonly used IDEs

-Spyder
-PyCharm
-Jupyter Notebook
-Atom

But in this course we are going to be looking at jupyter notebook; and that is primarily because it is a very good software that has been developed only for data science and python; and it as an interface that is very very appealing and easy to use for beginners.

## Jupyter Notebook

-Web application that allows creation and manipulation of notebook documents called 'notebook',

-Supported across Linux, Mac Os X and windows platforms.

-Available as open source version.

-Bundled with Anaconda distribution or can be installed seperately.

-Supports Julia, Python, R and Scala.
 
-Consists of ordered collection of input and output cells that contain code,text,plots etc.

-Allows sharing of code and narrative text through output format likePDF,HTML etc.
